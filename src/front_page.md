# Welcome

This paper provides an overview on modern approaches to open and reproducible science applied to computer simulation.  Our focus is on practical tools and techniques; aiming to provide current and future researchers in computer simulation with skills needed to push the field forward at a faster rate. We focus on the following areas: free and open computer simulation packages; reproducible software environments; cloud tools to enable cloud runnable artefacts; synthetic data; accessibility and licensing; and documentation to help other research teams.  All code used in this paper is available, cloud runnable an reusable under an MIT license.

The materials here are not intended to be exhaustive and are definitely not an introduction the Python language.  There are many fantastic resources available online for more indepth coverage of what we introduce as well as Python.  

For example, for more simulation examples along with other data science content in Python:
